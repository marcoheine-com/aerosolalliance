## Aerosol Alliance Website

This is the repository for the aerosol alliance website.

> The Aerosol Alliance has formed to challenge the way the spray paint industry
> manufactures, distributes and recycles aerosol spray cans. As creatives that
> are passionate about Graffiti and Urban art, we hope to unite the artistic
> community to drive research, innovation and solutions for our most loved
> medium.

## Tech stack

We use React along with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). For styling we use
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The Content ist stored in the headless
CMS [Prismic](https://prismic.io/). For deployment we use
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## App strucure

### üìÑ Pages

Every file inside the pages folder will render as a page with its own route.

### üçï Slices

[Slices](https://prismic.io/docs/core-concepts/slices) are reusable Prismic
Components. They can be used on pages to add dynamic content.

You can use the slicemachine to see all the available slices or add new ones.
See [Prismic Slicemachine](#prismic-slicemachine) on how to use it.

### üß± Components

Files which are reusable and aren't slices or pages will be located in the
components folder.
