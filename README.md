## Aerosol Alliance Website
This is the repository for the aerosol alliance website.

>The Aerosol Alliance has formed to challenge the way the spray paint industry manufactures, distributes and recycles aerosol spray cans. As creatives that are passionate about Graffiti and Urban art, we hope to unite the artistic community to drive research, innovation and solutions for our most loved medium.
